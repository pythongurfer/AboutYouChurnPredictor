# ABOUT YOU - Customer Churn Predictor 

### An End-to-End MLOps Pipeline to Proactively Identify and Reduce Customer Churn

This project demonstrates a full-stack MLOps approach to predict customer churn for a fashion e-commerce platform like **ABOUT YOU**. It covers everything from data versioning and experiment tracking to automated model deployment via a REST API.

## The Business Problem

In e-commerce, customer retention is cheaper and more effective than customer acquisition. This project tackles this challenge by building a machine learning system that identifies customers who are at a high risk of churning. By flagging these users proactively, the business can launch targeted retention campaigns (e.g., special offers, personalized outreach) to improve customer loyalty and protect revenue.

Experiment Tracking with MLflow
All training runs are logged in MLflow, allowing for systematic comparison of model parameters and performance metrics. This ensures reproducibility and helps in selecting the best model for production.

Live API Demo
The final model is deployed as a REST API using FastAPI. Here is a quick demo showing a curl or Postman request with sample customer data and the returned churn prediction.

Export to Sheets
Local Setup & Usage
Follow these steps to run the project locally.

1. Clone the Repository
Bash

# Replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO with your details
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git)
cd YOUR_REPO
2. Set Up Environment & Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment and install all required packages.

Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the MLOps Pipeline
This will simulate the full workflow. Run each command in a separate terminal.

Bash

# Terminal 1: Run the training script to log experiments
python scripts/train.py

# Terminal 2: Start the MLflow UI to view results
# The `--backend-store-uri` flag ensures the UI reads from the correct database
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri mlruns/

# Terminal 3: Start the FastAPI server
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
The API is now running! You can view the interactive documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

Running with Docker
You can also build and run the entire application as a Docker container for a completely isolated environment.

Bash

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t churn-predictor .

# Run the container, exposing the API on port 8000
docker run -p 8000:8000 churn-predictor

Future Improvements
Cloud Deployment: Deploy the Docker container to a cloud service like AWS ECS or Google Cloud Run for a scalable, production-ready setup.

Feature Store: Implement a feature store (e.g., Feast) to standardize feature engineering and reuse across models.

Model Monitoring: Add monitoring to the deployed API to detect data drift or model performance degradation over time.
